    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>
In principle the current process fulfills of the needs of scheduling work crews to perform the requested services.  However, it has not adapted to expanding coverage areas or advances in technology.  It currently relies on regional facilitates to coordinate the work crews and there schedules, but with so many regional areas the process is beginning to feel the stain of its own size.  The proposed process changes aim at centralization and consistency of customer experience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The first major change is to centralize the customer service center.  The goal is to have to customer call into one location and not have to be transferred to complete the call.  To do this the customer service representative will need to be able to access the full customer database, all of the regional work crew schedules as well as complete related sub process like new customer connections.  Having all of this information at the ready for the customer service representative will allow them to respond quickly to a customs request without having to put the customer on hold, or transfer them to an other department.

    </figure-->
    <p>
    The second challenge will be coordinating with regional work crew scheduling.  Regional work crews are necessary because of the large service area that The Company covers and the reality  that events in the field can take place faster than they can be reported to a central schedule is necessary to account for.  This is why the proposed process includes a review and approval of the regional scheduling offices.  This will ensure that the work scheduled by the customer service team does not conflict with the changing landscape of events that take place in the field.  Previously this was handled by having the regional scheduling departments schedule the work crew wile the customer was on hold with the customer service representative.  In the proposed process the review will take place in parallel or after the customer has completed there call.  The process will assume that the schedule available to custom serve is correct only recontacting the customer if there is a conflict with he schedule identified by the regional scheduling department. This is aimed at reducing the time the customer is on hold during the call, improving the overall continuity of the call.

    <p>
    The proposed changes are not without costs, but overall the centralization of the customer service department will result in a cost savings.  Looking at the breakdown of major costs it can be seen that there is a large annual cost, in terms of staff and facilities, to maintaining regional customer service centers, $1.2 million dollars.  That is half of the $2.4 million dollar budgeted for this part of the process.  Presently the regional customers service department are collocated with the regional scheduling departments, this is because it is presently the only way to ensure that customer service has up to date informer about the work crew schedules, sometimes even physically going and taking to the scheduling supervisor.  This means at least one customer service representative at each of the regional service centers and it means that when customer calls are low the staff is underutilized.  By centralizing the customer service process and staff, all of the work can be done with fewer staff which means less cost.
    </p>
    <p>
    Labor is not the only cost, new hardware and software to centralize that data and to make it accessible across all of the service regions will be needed for the proposed process.  At present each region maintains there own work crew schedule as well as a subset of customer information.  These are maintained with minimal hardware and software resource which range from local serves with web interfaces to spreadsheets on an individuals workstation.  To provide a uniform method of storage and interface, new systems would need to be installed and maintained that will provide one central scheduling method.  These systems will come at increased cost over the current systems more than tripling the annual costs from $35,000 to $125,000.
    </p>
    <p>
    Evaluating the overall costs the proposed process would save an estimated $783,000 dollars annually.  Based upon the cost alone, moving to the new process would be good for The Company as it would reduct the total operating costs.  There are still other advantages for moving to the new process and thous come in the effect it has on customer satisfaction.  The new process reduced the average amount of time the customer spends on hold from almost 7 minutes down to less than 1 minute.  It also reduces the average over all call length from 22 minutes down to just 6 minutes. These changes are expected to have a direct impact on customer satisfaction, improving how the customer perceives The Company from a rating of moderate to poor service to a rating of good to excellent service.  This rating is one of the key variables in behavior models used to determine how likely a customer is to participate in an power conservation effort.  A satisfaction rating going from moderate service to good service increases the likelihood of participation by almost 7%, a signifiant about.
    </p>
    <p>
    From the perspective of cost and effectiveness in improving target goals the proposed changes have no down side.  The new process costs less to operate and should have the desired effect of increasing customer satisfaction.  There are other concerns, such as workers displaced from regional facilities that can not transfer to a central location or incorporation of remote connect and disconnect.  These concerns are still being evaluated as part of the proposed changes to the business model but it is believed that each of the concerns can be resolved satisfactorily.
