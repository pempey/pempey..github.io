            	<p class="text-justify">The system surrounding the service scheduling process is complex and dynamic.  The benefits from and improved process do not directly translate into improved revenue for The Company but are part of a case and effect chain that includes grid load and company revenue.  In an effort to determine if the proposed business model ultimately had the desired impact of improving customer conservation, and therefor reducing costs, several parts of this dynamic system were evaluated.  These evaluations were targeted to identify if the outcome of the changed business process was worth price of change.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The first step in developing a model for the dynamic system of which the service scheduling is  apart of is to identify the entities that form casual loops and chains.  This is a conceptual excursive used to show what is causing the effects seen in the real world system.  It shows the relationships between entities as well as the direction of influence.  A more detailed explanation of Casual Loop Diagrams can be found at the <link>Business Prototyping Blog <link>. One of the casual loop diagrams that was generated for this evaluation is shown here.  It is a diagram of how the wait time during a service call is connected to customer conservation and company revenue.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">From the causal loop diagrams stock and flow models were generated.  Stock and flow models are a way to visual communicate the mathematical relationship between entities.  The stock and flow models developed for the investigation of the proposed business process looked at the effect of call wait time and service completion time and how they impacted the overall revenue of The Company.  Through the development of these models the complex mathematics that represent the relationships between entities were identified and then used to simulate the system. </p>

        <h2>Simulation Results</h2>
        	
<p class="text-justify">
    The main purpose of simulating the dynamic systems was to make a prediction about the future behavior of the system and the impact that the proposed changes would have on the that forecast.  As the driver that was trying to be effected was the customer satisfaction, there were two scenes that were looked at that would positively impact customer satisfaction: Customer Service Calls and Service Completion.  Both of these scenarios showed an improvement over the baseline expected growth in revenue but the Customer Service Calls showed a greater effect over the five year duration of the simulation with continual growth every year.  This was what the expected outcome was and it shows that the proposed changes to the business model can result in a positive growth in revenue.  This result, in conjunction with the lower annual cost of the new process, indicates that the results are worth the price what will be paid with the transition to the new process.
