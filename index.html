  <h2>Improving the customer experience and reducing costs</h2>
  <p>
    As a power generation and distribution organization The Company is continually trying to find ways to deliver consistent and low cost energy to its customers.  The power that The Company distributes comes from many sources, the most cost effective way to increase the amount of energy that The Company can distribute comes from encouraging the customers to use less of that power.  This may appear to be contradictory, however given the limited capacity for generation and lack of storage capacity the power, when one customer uses less, that saved capacity for power can then be used to another effectively acting as a generation source.  The cost of programs that encourage reduced power usage is far less expensive than building or contracting with a traditional generation source, by almost 50%.  This is why The Company is always focused on reducing costs in programs that encourage customers to use less power, it keeps the total cost of that power source low.

    Customer surveys and past program data show that customer satisfaction is strongly correlated with willingness to participate in power conservation efforts.  One of The Companyâ€™s business processes that was showing a negative impact on customer satisfaction was scheduling of service requests.  Customers commented that the process was very frustrating; lost transfer calls and being put on hold repeatedly.  This frustration, especially when the customer was connecting service for the first time, impacted the overall perceptions of The Company, reducing the willingness for customers to participate in power conservation efforts.

    <p>
   
    Indeed when the process was investigated it was found to have inefficiencies that can be improved upon.  For example the Central Customer Service department handled all incoming calls, but would have to transfer the customer to a regional Customer Service department in order to work with regional scheduling information.  This is one example of transferring the customer and not adding value to the customer experience.  Other inefficiencies arise from the siloing of information,  customer service representatives don't have access to work crew schedules and have to ask for up to date information with each customer request.  These inefficiencies increase customer frustration and duplicate work across several regions increasing the cost of the process.  And it is these inefficient pieces that the Proposed Business Model targeted in an effort to reduce the operating cost and increase customer satisfaction.
